# JFK-Assassination-2025-Release

JFK Assassination Records - 2025 Documents Release files and the script to download all the files.

## Analysis Summary 

The CIA’s detailed tracking of Oswald, combined with unclear affiliations (e.g., DBA-2088-3), potential KGB ties, and the handling of third-party claims (e.g., Czornonoh’s), could imply that some information was either withheld, underexplored, or intentionally minimized—perhaps to protect institutional interests, avoid Cold War escalation, or preserve the lone gunman conclusion.

The notes hint at a possible cover-up through omission and ambiguity—particularly regarding intelligence agencies’ knowledge of Oswald.
